# Pedagogical Framework

This file defines the core educational principles, learning theories, and instructional design approaches that guide all content development decisions across the Content Strategy team.

---

## Core Learning Philosophy

**Experiential Learning with Real-World Application**: Education should connect learners' natural curiosity to real-world experiences through hands-on, project-based learning that transitions from instructor-led to learner-led models with mentors as coaches.

---

## Primary Framework: 3P Model

### 1. Phenomenon (Engaging with Real-World Experiences)
- Connect to learner's natural curiosity and real-world experiences
- Use learner-centered design with problems aligned to student interests
- Employ experiential learning in tangible, real-world contexts
- Embrace "Low Floor, High Ceiling, Wide Wall" accessibility approach

### 2. Principle (Identifying Underlying Concepts)
- Help learners identify concepts and theories behind observed phenomena
- Develop critical and creative thinking through collaboration
- Use Creative Learning Spiral: imagine → create → play → share → reflect → iterate
- Maintain transparency in learning using open-source technologies

### 3. Practice (Applying Concepts Through Hands-On Activities)
- Move from theoretical knowledge to practical competence
- Use project-based learning addressing community needs
- Implement blended learning with synchronous mentoring and self-paced modules
- Transition from instructor-led to learner-led model with mentors as coaches

---

## Course Structure Standards

### Project Organization
- Each course has three projects (A, B, C)
- Each project consists of 4 lessons (2 Class + 2 Lab sessions, 1 hour each)
- Sessions alternate between mentor-led instruction and student-led application
- Naming pattern: A1 Class, A1 Lab, A2 Class, A2 Lab (and so on for Projects B and C)

### Session Types
- **Class sessions**: Mentor-led instruction where learners are introduced to new concepts, participate in guided demonstrations, and discuss underlying principles
- **Lab sessions**: Student-led application where learners apply concepts from the previous Class session, with mentors acting as facilitators

## Lesson Flow Requirements

### Mandatory Structure
1. **Contextual introduction** - Link to prior experience / real-world hook
2. **Learning objectives** - Blockquote format with bullet list
3. **Scenario** - 1-3 short sentences setting the context
4. **Step-by-step instructions** - Clear action verbs with sub-steps indented 4 spaces
5. **Embedded reflection prompts** - Throughout the lesson
6. **Share & Reflect** - Wrap-up with peer discussion

### 3P Mapping Requirements
- **Phenomenon**: Real-world hook or problem (introduction/scenario)
- **Principle**: Underlying concept/theory (main instruction)
- **Practice**: Hands-on application (steps and reflection)

---

## Documentation Style Guidelines

### Formatting Standards
- Use 4 spaces for indentation in markdown lists
- First-level headings: Title-style capitalization
- Second-level+ headings: Sentence-style capitalization
- Bold for key terms and definitions
- Italics for text in parentheses
- Consistent terminology throughout

### Visual Elements
- Include relevant images with proper alt text and width specifications
- Use callout formats: `> 💡` (tips), `> ⚠️` (warnings), `> 📖` (references)
- Format code blocks with triple back-ticks and language identifier
- Suggest decorative images where they enhance understanding

### Content Organization
- Use headings and subheadings for logical structure
- Break complex ideas into bullet points and numbered lists
- Incorporate tables/diagrams for comparisons and relationships
- Provide one-sentence explanations for specialized terminology

---

## Quality Standards

### Content Requirements
- Accurate, relevant, and easy to understand
- Include examples, visuals, and analogies where appropriate
- Maintain neutral and informative tone
- Ensure all references are accurately cited and up-to-date
- Support both foundational and advanced learning needs

### Accessibility Standards
- "Low Floor, High Ceiling, Wide Wall" approach
- Multiple entry points for different skill levels
- Progressive complexity with clear scaffolding
- Inclusive design for diverse learning needs

---

## Assessment Philosophy

### Learning Objectives Format
- Must be written in blockquote format with bullet points
- Should be measurable and aligned with 3P framework
- Focus on both knowledge acquisition and practical application

### Reflection Integration
- Embed reflection prompts throughout lessons
- End each lesson with "Share & Reflect" section
- Use Creative Learning Spiral: imagine → create → play → share → reflect → iterate

---

##  Implementation Guidelines

### Content Development Process
1. **Phenomenon identification**: Find real-world hook/problem
2. **Principle articulation**: Define underlying concepts to be learned
3. **Practice design**: Create hands-on application activities
4. **Flow structuring**: Organize using mandatory lesson flow structure
5. **Style application**: Apply formatting and documentation standards
6. **Quality review**: Ensure all standards and requirements are met

### Review Criteria
- Progressive learning structure from foundational to advanced
- Consistency in terminology and style
- Accessibility for target audience
- Alignment with 3P framework
- Examples and visuals enhance understanding
- Clear, actionable instructions with appropriate callouts
