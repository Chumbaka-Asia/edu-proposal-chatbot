## My Story: Why This Project Matters

### The Problem I Discovered
[2-3 paragraphs telling the story of:
- How you learned about this problem
- Who it affects and why it matters
- What you observed or learned from your community partner
- Why existing solutions aren't working]

### My Big Question
After understanding the problem, I asked myself:

> "[Your data-driven question here - the hypothesis you want to test]"

**Why This Question Matters:** [2-3 sentences explaining the real-world impact if you can answer this question]

---

## My Approach: The Data Science Method

### What I Measured
To answer my question, I needed to collect data about:

- **Primary Measurements:** [What sensor/data you collected - be specific]
- **Context Information:** [Other factors you tracked - like location, time, material type]
- **The Label:** [What you were trying to predict - Acceptable/Not Acceptable, etc.]

### How I Created Reliable Labels
[Explain in 2-3 sentences how you created reliable labels for your data. What objective rules did you use? Who helped verify the labels?]

**Example:** "Padmani and her team examined each saree using two checks: (1) Is fading clearly visible? (2) Is fraying more than 5 cm? If both answers were 'No,' we labeled the saree as Acceptable."

### My Data Collection Setup

**What I Used:**
- Hardware: [Specific sensors/equipment]
- Location: [Where you collected data]
- Sample Size: [How many samples from how many items]
- Time Period: [When you collected data]

**Data Structure:**
```
Each row in my dataset contains:
- [Feature 1]: [description]
- [Feature 2]: [description]
- [Feature 3]: [description]
- Target Label: [what you're predicting]
```

### Initial Dataset Snapshot

Here's a preview of my dataset:

| Feature 1       | Feature 2       | Feature 3       | Target Label   |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| [Value]         | [Value]         | [Value]         | [Label]        |
| [Value]         | [Value]         | [Value]         | [Label]        |
| [Value]         | [Value]         | [Value]         | [Label]        |

Key statistics about my data:
- **Total Samples:** [number]
- **Class Distribution:** [e.g., "70% Acceptable, 30% Not Acceptable"]
- **Median/Mean Values:** [any relevant stats]

## Cleaning My Data: Making It Ready

### Challenges I Found
When I first looked at my data, I discovered:

1. **[Issue 1]:** [e.g., "Some material types were written as 'Silk' and others as 'silk'"]
   - **Solution:** [What you did to fix it]

2. **[Issue 2]:** [e.g., "2 readings had missing values"]
   - **Solution:** [What you did to fix it]

3. **[Issue 3]:** [e.g., "2 sensor readings were extreme outliers"]
   - **Solution:** [What you did to fix it]

### Final Dataset
After cleaning:
- **Total samples:** [number] rows
- **Features used:** [list them]
- **Data quality:** [any notes about balance, representation, etc.]

## Training the Model: Teaching the Computer

### Algorithm Choice
I chose **[Algorithm Name]** because: [1-2 sentences explaining why this algorithm fits your problem]

### Training Process
[2-3 sentences describing:
- What features you fed to the model
- How you split your data (if you did train/test split)
- Any challenges during training]

### Results
My model achieved:
- **Accuracy:** [percentage]
- **What this means:** [Explain in plain language - "This means the system correctly identifies 87 out of every 100 sarees"]

**Comparison to Goal:** [Did you meet your target? By how much?]

## Deployment: Making It Real

### Where It Will Be Used
[Describe the real-world setting where your solution will operate. Be specific about location and context. For the pilot version, consider using a smaller setting.]

### How It Works
When someone uses my system:

1. **Input:** [What the user does - e.g., "Place saree under sensor"]
2. **Processing:** [What the system does - e.g., "Device measures light reflection and transmittance"]
3. **Output:** [What feedback they get - e.g., "Green LED = Accept, Red LED = Reject"]

### Safety Plan
I'm aware that my model isn't perfect. Here's how I'm handling errors:

**Risk 1 - False Accept:** [What happens if system accepts bad item]
- **Impact:** [Why this is problematic]
- **Mitigation:** [How you're preventing/handling this]

**Risk 2 - False Reject:** [What happens if system rejects good item]
- **Impact:** [Why this is problematic]
- **Mitigation:** [How you're preventing/handling this]

### Continuous Improvement
To make my system better over time:

1. **Feedback Collection:** [How will you track when the model is wrong?]
2. **Learning Loop:** [What will you do with disagreements?]
3. **Retraining Plan:** [When/how will you update the model?]
